/**
 * The model part of the MVC-software model: consists of little and where present, well isolated io- and graphics work. It is meant to 
 * as far as possible be formal and only handle abstractions.<br><br>
 * 
 * Only formal stuff: {@link model.logic}<br><br>
 * 
 * Must somehow formally model the descriptive part as well: {@link model.description}<br><br>
 *
 * Primary interfaces: {@link model.logic.abstraction.Formal} and {@link model.description.abstraction.Described}<br><br>
 * 
 * Well isolated graphics and io: {@link DRectangle}<br><br>
